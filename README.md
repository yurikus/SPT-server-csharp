## Contributing

We're really excited that you're interested in contributing! Before submitting your contribution, please consider the following:

### Branches

- **master**
  The default branch used for the latest stable release. This branch is protected and typically is only merged with release branches.
- **develop**
  The main branch for server development. **PRs should target this.**

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Keep Them Small**
  If you're fixing a bug, try to keep the changes to the bug fix only. If you're adding a feature, try to keep the changes to the feature only. This will make it easier to review and merge your changes.
- **Perform a Self-Review**
  Before submitting your changes, review your own code. This will help you catch any mistakes you may have made.
- **Remove Noise**
  Remove any unnecessary changes to white space, code style formatting, or some text change that has no impact related to the intention of the PR.
- **Create a Meaningful Title**
  When creating a PR, make sure the title is meaningful and describes the changes you've made.
- **Write Detailed Commit Messages**
  Bring out your table manners, speak the Queen's English and be on your best behaviour.

### Git Large File Storage (LFS)

We use a custom git LFS server to store large files. The public server is read-only. If you are adding or modifying large files, you will need to create an issue with details about this change so that a project developer can make them to a writable endpoint of the LFS server. Bonus points if you include a patch file in the issue. **You will not be able to submit a pull request for LFS file changes.**

### Style Guide

We use [CSharpier](https://csharpier.com/) to keep the project's code styled/formatted. You can install it globally by running: `dotnet tool install -g csharpier`. You may then apply the formatting rules by running: `csharpier format .`. Please ensure this is ran before your PR is created to make merges easier. A workflow will fail if formatting changes are required.

#### Format On Save

There are Plugins for both [VS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=csharpier.csharpier-vscode) and [Rider](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18243-csharpier) which allow you to automatically format project code when a file is saved.

In Rider, after installing the CSharpier plugin:
- Open `Settings`
- Browse to `Editor`, `Code Style`:
    - Set scheme to `Project`
    - Check `Enable EditorConfig Support`
- Browse to `Tools`, `CSharpier`:
    - Enable "Run On Save"
- Browse to `Tools`, `Actions on save`:
    - Check `Reformat and Cleanup Code`
    - Set to `Reformat & Apply Syntax Style`, `Changed lines`

### Tests

We have a number of tests that are run automatically when you submit a pull request. You can run these tests locally by running The unit test sub-project. If you're adding a new feature or fixing a bug, please consider adding tests to cover your changes so that we can ensure they don't break in the future.
